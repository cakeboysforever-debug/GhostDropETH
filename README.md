# GhostDropETH - Affiliate-Ready VPN Guide

This repository contains a polished affiliate landing page and companion guide for promoting vetted VPN offers. Use it as a plug-and-play template: drop in your affiliate IDs, regenerate the PDF, and deploy to GitHub Pages.

## What‚Äôs Inside

- `guide.md` ‚Äì The Markdown source for the full VPN guide, including deal tables, setup steps, and FAQs. Update the `YOUR_*_AFFILIATE_ID` placeholders with the IDs from your affiliate dashboards.
- `guide.pdf` ‚Äì A generated PDF version of the guide. Regenerate this file after updating `guide.md` so the downloadable version stays in sync.
- `index.html` ‚Äì A modern landing page highlighting the featured deals with disclosure copy that matches the guide.
- `disclose.md` ‚Äì Reusable disclosure text you can embed in additional assets (emails, blog posts, etc.).
- `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` ‚Äì GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to `main`.
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì Keeps build artifacts and secrets out of version control.

## Customize the Affiliate Links

1. Sign up for the NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN affiliate programs (Impact/PartnerStack/etc.).
2. Replace each `YOUR_*_AFFILIATE_ID` placeholder in `guide.md` and `index.html` with your assigned affiliate ID or tracking token.
3. Optionally add `aff_sub` or `utm_*` parameters for campaign tracking.

> üí° Tip: Store your IDs in a `.env` file and use a templating step if you maintain multiple variants (e.g., TikTok vs. newsletter campaigns).

## Regenerate the PDF

Pandoc is the simplest way to regenerate `guide.pdf`:

```bash
pandoc guide.md -o guide.pdf --from markdown --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf
```

If Pandoc or `wkhtmltopdf` is not installed locally, install them via Homebrew (`brew install pandoc wkhtmltopdf`) or your package manager of choice.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Commit your affiliate ID updates.
3. Push to `main`. The included workflow will build and publish the landing page to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. In GitHub, enable Pages and set the source to the deployed branch (GitHub Actions).

Your live site will be available at:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/GhostDropETH/
```

Share that URL anywhere you promote the guide.
