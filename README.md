# GhostDropETH - Affiliate-Ready VPN Guide

This repository now pairs the polished affiliate landing page with a lightweight OSINT profiling workflow. Drop in your affiliate IDs, regenerate the PDF, and run the included profiling script to keep your due diligence notes close at hand before you publish.

## What‚Äôs Inside

- `guide.md` ‚Äì The Markdown source for the full VPN guide, including deal tables, setup steps, and FAQs. Update the `YOUR_*_AFFILIATE_ID` placeholders with the IDs from your affiliate dashboards.
- `guide.pdf` ‚Äì A generated PDF version of the guide. Regenerate this file after updating `guide.md` so the downloadable version stays in sync.
- `index.html` ‚Äì A modern landing page highlighting the featured deals, your OSINT checkpoints, and disclosure copy that matches the guide.
- `disclose.md` ‚Äì Reusable disclosure text you can embed in additional assets (emails, blog posts, etc.).
- `data_providers.json` ‚Äì Structured OSINT notes that back the claims in the guide and landing page.
- `osint_profile.py` ‚Äì Tiny reporting script that prints the OSINT profile for each provider.
- `campaign_profiles.json` / `campaign_osint.py` ‚Äì Store username-level OSINT notes by campaign and render them as shareable dossiers.
- `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` ‚Äì GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the site to GitHub Pages whenever you push to `main`.
- `.gitignore` ‚Äì Keeps build artifacts and secrets out of version control.

## Customize the Affiliate Links

1. Sign up for the NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN affiliate programs (links below).
2. Replace each `YOUR_*_AFFILIATE_ID` placeholder in `guide.md` and `index.html` with your assigned affiliate ID or tracking token.
3. Run the OSINT profile script (see below) to confirm your talking points match the latest disclosures.
4. Refresh the username dossiers so each campaign has vetted creators and outreach notes ready to go.
5. Scrape Reddit searches + forums for new leads before each campaign push to tailor your outreach.
6. Optionally add `aff_sub` or `utm_*` parameters for campaign tracking.

> üí° Tip: Store your IDs in a `.env` file and use a templating step if you maintain multiple variants (e.g., TikTok vs. newsletter campaigns).

## Regenerate the PDF

Pandoc is the simplest way to regenerate `guide.pdf`:

```bash
pandoc guide.md -o guide.pdf --from markdown --pdf-engine=wkhtmltopdf
```

If Pandoc or `wkhtmltopdf` is not installed locally, install them via Homebrew (`brew install pandoc wkhtmltopdf`) or your package manager of choice.

## Run the OSINT Profiling Script

The repository includes a tiny helper that turns the structured OSINT notes into a readable checklist you can paste into briefs or campaign documentation:

```bash
python osint_profile.py           # Print every provider profile
python osint_profile.py NordVPN   # Print a single provider
```

Update `data_providers.json` whenever you complete new checks (audits, ownership changes, breach disclosures) so the script stays accurate.

## Maintain Username OSINT Templates

Keep campaign-specific vetting in `campaign_profiles.json`. Each entry captures the niche, objectives, discovery channels, and the usernames you plan to work with.

```bash
python campaign_osint.py                 # Print every campaign dossier
python campaign_osint.py "Remote Work Security Blitz"  # Single campaign by name
python campaign_osint.py --template      # Output a blank JSON template for new campaigns
```

Duplicate the template block for each new campaign or niche you spin up. Update `vetting_status`, `risk_flags`, and `last_reviewed` as your outreach progresses so stakeholders can see which handles are cleared for pitches.

## Scrape Community Leads (Reddit + Forums)

Use the `lead_scraper.py` helper to surface active discussions where people are researching VPNs, troubleshooting streaming blocks, or weighing privacy tools. The script queries a curated set of subreddit searches and RSS feeds, then prints a timestamped digest you can triage before engaging.

```bash
python lead_scraper.py            # Plain-text digest
python lead_scraper.py --json     # Machine-readable output for Airtable/Notion imports
python lead_scraper.py --limit 10 # Increase posts pulled per source
```

Edit the `REDDIT_SEARCHES` and `FORUM_FEEDS` lists in `lead_scraper.py` to match the verticals you care about (streaming, gaming, travel, etc.). Each run emits warnings instead of failing hard if a feed goes down or returns rate-limit errors, making it safe to wire into cron jobs or CI automations.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Commit your affiliate ID updates.
3. Push to `main`. The included workflow will build and publish the landing page to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. In GitHub, enable Pages and set the source to the deployed branch (GitHub Actions).

Your live site will be available at:
