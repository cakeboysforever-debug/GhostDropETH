## Why Use a VPN in 2025?

- Protects your privacy on public Wi-Fi and at home by encrypting traffic end-to-end.
- Prevents your ISP from selling your browsing data to third parties.
- Lets you access region-locked content (Netflix, Prime Video, sports), safely torrent, and bypass censorship while traveling.
- Adds a critical security layer for remote work by shielding passwords, chats, and financial data.

## How We Vet Providers (OSINT Profiling)

Before recommending any VPN, we run lightweight OSINT checks and log the results in `data_providers.json`. The companion `osint_profile.py` script prints a portable summary covering:

- Headquarters and ownership transparency
- Independent security or no-logs audits (with year and firm)
- Known breach disclosures and remediation notes
- Warrant canary status and transparency reporting cadence

Update the JSON whenever new evidence lands‚Äîespecially after audits, acquisitions, or major security incidents. Re-run the script and include the highlights in your campaign briefs so every affiliate push is backed by verifiable facts.

- **Password Manager:** 1Password or Bitwarden with 2FA enabled.
- **Data Removal Service:** Incogni or DeleteMe to reduce data broker exposure.
- **Secure DNS:** Enable NordVPN's Threat Protection or Surfshark's CleanWeb to block malicious domains.

## FAQ

**Q: Will a VPN slow down my internet?**  
A: Modern protocols like WireGuard and Lightway minimize the performance hit. Choose nearby servers to keep latency low.

**Q: Is it legal to use a VPN?**  
A: Yes, in most countries. Some regions restrict VPN usage for political reasons. Always comply with local laws.

**Q: Can I use a VPN for streaming services?**  
A: Yes, but stick with providers that actively refresh IP addresses. ExpressVPN and NordVPN are consistently reliable for Netflix, Disney+, and BBC iPlayer.
